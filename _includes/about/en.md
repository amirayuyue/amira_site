Hey, I am Yue Yu (a.k.a. _@amirayuyue_). I worked on the [OIT Team](https://it.ucmerced.edu/Research-Computing-People) at University of California, Merced.

I considered myself as a hybrid between a researcher and a full-time staff at the university. Even though I have my full-time HPC facilitator job, I still  hold high passion into research especially computational chemistry. 

In the past, I worked as a postdoctoral scholar at [Dr. Shi's](https://shi-theory-group.github.io/) group, where I mainly focused on understanding the interface morphology of donor-acceptor organic solar cell (OSC) material. Using the computer modeling method, we were able to predict the vibrational solvatochromism with interface at different surrounding environment, comparing with the experimental data, we were able to provide in-depth atomic resolution interpretation interface structure which largely help study the performance of OSC material. Before joining Dr. Shi's group, I spent 1 year at [Dr. Lemkul's](https://www.thelemkullab.com/) lab to study protein structure and potentially each amino acid influence of the protein structure to support the early stage detection of the Alzheimer's disease. 

I studied BS, Chemical Engineering at [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/) and Ph.D.,Chemical Engineering (with a focus on understanding inhibition of a biodesulfurization enzyme to improrve sulfur removal from petroleum, supervised by [Dr. Payne](http://www.christypayne.com/) at [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/).
